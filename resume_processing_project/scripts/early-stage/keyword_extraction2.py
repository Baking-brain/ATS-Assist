PROJECTS
‚óè
ATS Assist: Resume Enhancer using NLP and LLMs- Developed a system for improving resumes on aspects like
Grammar, use of keywords and impactful sentence formation using Languagetool API, NLP (BERT with TF-IDF scoring
for relevant keywords) and LLM for sentence generation. TF-IDF will help in scoring the keywords associated with the
job role on which BERT model will be trained on. LLM (mistral) used for text generation catering to specific resumes.
‚óè
VocabLearn: English Vocabulary Enhancer using Leitner approach- Solved challenges of vocabulary improvement
by implementing a flashcard approach (Leitner system) and dynamic difficulty shifting of words using Linear
Regression. Created my own dataset of 1300+ GRE words by performing web scraping using BeautifulSoup (BS4) and
Selenium with the help of Chrome Webdriver from a trusted source. It also showed stats based on users progress.
‚óè
Email Client with user authentication (Developing)- Implementing an email client using IMAP and SMTP protocols
and Django for a smooth backend. GraphQL for API communication and Google OAuth for Security. This project helps
me get a better understanding of communications from APIs and frontend.
‚óè
Property Price Prediction- Created a price prediction model with a dataset for the properties in Bangalore. Performed
ETL (cleaning, Transformation, Outlier Detection). Trained the model on multiple parameters after performing feature
engineering and dimensionality reduction. Tried models like Multi-linear Regression, Lasso Regression.
